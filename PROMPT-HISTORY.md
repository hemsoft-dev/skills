2026-01-18 - 21:30 - Add prompt history logging workflow to AGENTS.md as top priority
Result: Created new section in AGENTS.md with clear guidelines for logging meaningful prompts (feature requests, bug fixes, architecture decisions). Added to Critical Rules and Summary Checklist. Created PROMPT-HISTORY.md with format: YYYY-MM-DD - HH:MM - prompt summary + result.

2026-01-30 - 10:00 - Revert Ctrl+Shift+S shortcut from Cursor to VS Code Insiders with Skills repo
Result: Successfully updated AutoHotkey script, documentation, and history logging. Committed and pushed changes despite pre-existing linting issues.

2026-01-30 - 11:48 - Process latest screenshot and commit changes with Slack/Twitter filename prefixes
Result: Successfully imported Slack screenshot from angular-hotline channel, created ask-user-questions skill for spec-based development, added automatic prefix detection for Slack (slack-) and Twitter (tweet-) screenshots, fixed Markdown linting issues, and committed/pushed all changes.
2026-01-30 - 13:23 - Fix Productivity skill commit data collection script parsing
Result: Resolved PowerShell delimiter preservation issue by rewriting collect-github-commits.ps1 to write git output to temp file first, then parse from file. Script now successfully extracts commits into JSON format with 55 repositories scanned and 3 commits found on 2026-01-30 with proper LOC calculations.
